# LoyaltyToken SDK

The LoyaltyToken SDK is a library that provides an interface for interacting with the LoyaltyToken smart contract. This SDK simplifies the process of sending and receiving LoyaltyTokens, managing allowances, and checking balances. This project is a WIP.

## Getting Started

To get started with the LoyaltyToken SDK, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: 
   `git clone https://github.com/Ardelerro/ETH-Loyalty-Points.git`
2. Install dependencies: 
   `cd loyalty-sdk`
   `npm install`
3. Configure your Ethereum provider URL and private key for `LoyaltySDK.ts`

## Features

- Get account balance
- Transfer LoyaltyTokens to other addresses
- Approve another address to spend tokens on your behalf
- Check the allowance granted to a spender
- Transfer tokens from an owner using the allowance mechanism

## Next Steps

This is a starting point for interacting with the LoyaltyToken smart contract, as well as developing the contract. Here are some potential next steps to enhance the project:

- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling for various scenarios to provide clear feedback to users.
- **Gas Optimization:** Optimize smart contract functions to reduce gas costs and improve efficiency.
- **Documentation:** Expand and improve documentation to provide detailed usage instructions and examples.
- **Continuous Integration:** Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
